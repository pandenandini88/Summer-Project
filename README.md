# Summer-Project
My project for summer 2022

This project was built because I was bored during the summer and and I wanted to learn something new.

To run this project:

1. First, you're going to need to download python and then django. You can do this by following the guide at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/install/ 

2. Next, it is recommended that you set up a virtual environment, which can be done with this tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

3. Finally, enter the command python -m pip install Django (if on Linux/Apple) or py -m pip install Django (if on Windows).

To use this porject:

As of now, not much can be done, but you can add/edit questions by going to admin/ and enter admin as the username, password as the password.
